# DNAweight
This program is an interesting tool to calculate various properties related to particle physics and the atomic composition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

# Constants: 
Defines some physical constants such as the speed of light, and conversions between units such as electronvolts to joules and joules to kilograms.

# Atomic Composition: 
Presents the atomic composition of various elements, including the number of protons, neutrons and the amount of each element.

# Quark Masses:
Defines the masses of the "up" and "down" quarks in MeV/c^2.

# Calculations and Unit Conversions:
Perform a series of calculations and conversions for each element, including:
  路 Total protons and neutrons per element.
  路 Number of up and down quarks for protons and neutrons.
  路 Energy in MeV/c^2 and its conversion to eV/c^2, then to joules/c^2, and finally to kilograms/c^2.
  路 Conversion from kilograms/c^2 to kilograms.

# Results: 
Shows the results of the calculations for each element.
